# rainfall_prediction
My project, titled Rain Prediction Using the Rainfall in Australia Dataset, aims to predict if it will rain the next day based on historical weather data. I used the Rainfall in Australia dataset, which includes weather attributes like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and previous rainfall amounts. This project involved extensive preprocessing and modeling, where I tested various machine learning algorithms such as CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers to find the best-performing model.
